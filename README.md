# Blackjack Strategy Simulator

This project evolved from a simple text-based game into a statistical analysis tool to study Blackjack strategy and probability.

## Key Features

- **Monte Carlo simulation:** Engineered a simulation engine to play 10,000+ hands of Blackjack automatically.
- **Basic Strategy:** Implemented the mathematically optimal Basic Strategy algorithm to make player decisions.
- **Data Analysis:** Utilised **Matplotlib** to analyse outcomes and calculate the house edge.
- **Visualization:** Created visualisations to demonstrate the probability of different game outcomes.

## Analysis Results

Running 10,000 hands with Basic Strategy revealed:

- **Player wins:** 3661 (36.6%)
- **Dealer wins:** 4939 (49.4%)
- **Pushes:** 979 (9.8%)
- **Player Blackjacks:** 421 (4.2%)
- **House edge:** 12.8%
