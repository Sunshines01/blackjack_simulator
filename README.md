This project evolved from a simple text-based game into a statistical analysis tool to study Blackjack strategy and probability.

## Key Features

- **Simulation:** Engineered a simulation engine to play 10,000+ hands of Blackjack automatically.
- **Basic Strategy:** Implemented the mathematically optimal Basic Strategy algorithm to make player decisions.
- **Data Analysis:** Utilized **Matplotlib** to analyze outcomes and calculate the house edge.
- **Visualization:** Created visualizations to demonstrate the probability of different game outcomes.
